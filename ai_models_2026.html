    <h2>Where Things Stand</h2>

    <p>Right now, we're looking at six models that dominate actual usage. Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, o3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, DeepSeek V3, and Llama 3.3. Between them, they cover most of what organizations need, from quick responses to deep reasoning, from consumer apps to enterprise deployments with strict privacy requirements.</p>

    <p>The context windows have gotten large enough that working with entire books isn't unusual anymore. Some of these handle text, images, audio, and video natively while others focus on doing one thing extremely well. Three are open source, which matters more than it used to.</p>

    <div class="chart-area">
        <div class="chart-heading">Speed vs Quality Trade-offs</div>
        <canvas id="performanceChart" style="max-height: 350px;"></canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>Claude Sonnet 4.5</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">Anthropic</div>
        <p>Claude has become a solid default for people who need consistent quality, with balance being the main thing that sets it apart. It's quick enough for daily work but doesn't cut corners on the thinking part.</p>
        
        <p>The 200,000 token context window means you can feed it entire documents without chunking them up. It handles document analysis and code generation particularly well. The trade-off is that when you need instant responses, other options are faster.</p>
        
        <p>Use this for technical writing, contract analysis, software development, or anything requiring you to connect information from multiple long sources.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>GPT-4o</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">OpenAI</div>
        <p>GPT-4o (the "o" stands for "omni") is OpenAI's attempt at building something that works with text, images, and audio all at once. Rather than connecting separate models together, they built it to handle everything natively.</p>
        
        <p>Response speed is good, and the ecosystem around it is mature with lots of tooling, extensive documentation, and plenty of community support. Pricing is competitive given what it does.</p>
        
        <p>Good fit for consumer applications, multichannel chatbots, visual content analysis, meeting transcription, and marketing content.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>o3</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">OpenAI</div>
        <p>The o3 model works differently than most by taking time to work through problems step by step instead of rushing to give you an answer. Closer to how people actually think through difficult stuff.</p>
        
        <p>It's slower and costs more than other models. When you're facing a genuinely difficult problem that requires careful reasoning though, those trade-offs make sense. Think of it less as a tool for everyday chat and more like bringing in a specialist consultant for the hard questions.</p>
        
        <p>Makes sense for scientific research, complex optimization, detailed financial analysis, academic work, or debugging intricate code issues.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Gemini 2.0 Flash</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">Google</div>
        <p>Google built Gemini 2.0 Flash for situations where waiting even a second feels too long. The whole focus is on speed, and they managed to do it without wrecking the quality too much.</p>
        
        <p>If you're already working within Google's ecosystem, the integration advantages are real. For high-volume applications where every millisecond of latency matters, this is probably your best option.</p>
        
        <p>Best suited for high-volume chatbots, real-time translation, customer support systems, mobile apps, or gaming with AI elements.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>DeepSeek V3</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">DeepSeek</div>
        <p>DeepSeek V3 kind of came out of nowhere last year. This open-source model from China performs about as well as the big commercial ones, costs way less to run, and you can see exactly how it's built.</p>
        
        <p>The catch is you need the technical capacity to deploy and optimize it yourself. For organizations with those skills though, the value proposition is hard to beat.</p>
        
        <p>Works well for projects with high volume where costs matter, situations requiring full transparency, or when you want to contribute to or benefit from open innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Llama 3.3</h2>
    <div class="model-block">
        <div class="model-title">Meta</div>
        <p>Meta keeps releasing new versions of Llama as open source, and 3.3 is the latest. It's become the standard choice when you need to keep everything on your own servers and don't want data leaving your control.</p>
        
        <p>Several financial institutions and hospitals have adopted it precisely because sensitive data never has to leave their infrastructure. The trade-off is managing everything yourself.</p>
        
        <p>Works particularly well in healthcare, finance, and defense where data sovereignty isn't negotiable. Also useful for prototyping, research, or deployments in environments without internet connectivity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tool-section">
        <h2>Which One Makes Sense?</h2>
        <p>What matters most for your situation?</p>
        
        <div class="options">
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('quality')">Quality</button>
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('speed')">Speed</button>
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('multimodal')">Multimodal</button>
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('privacy')">Privacy</button>
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('cost')">Cost</button>
            <button class="option-btn" onclick="showResult('reasoning')">Reasoning</button>
        </div>

        <div id="matchResult" class="result"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-area">
        <div class="chart-heading">Cost Comparison</div>
        <canvas id="costChart" style="max-height: 320px;"></canvas>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Relative cost per million tokens. Open source models require infrastructure investment.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What This Means Going Forward</h2>

    <p>Looking at these six models together, a few patterns become pretty clear.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <h3>Multiple Models Are Normal Now</h3>
        <p>The idea of picking one model and using it for everything doesn't really work anymore. Companies are mixing and matching depending on the task, like using o3 for hard problems, GPT-4o for talking to users, or DeepSeek V3 when running thousands of requests. You get better results and spend less money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h3>Open Source Caught Up</h3>
        <p>DeepSeek V3 and Llama 3.3 prove you don't have to compromise anymore if you go open source. They work about as well as the paid options while giving you complete control. This matters especially in industries like healthcare or finance where you really can't have data floating around on someone else's servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <h3>Text-Only Is Becoming a Liability</h3>
        <p>GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 both handle text, images, audio, and video without any fuss. That's just expected now, not special anymore. If a model can only work with text at this point, it's going to struggle to stay relevant for most uses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-area">
        <div class="chart-heading">Adoption Trends by Sector</div>
        <canvas id="adoptionChart" style="max-height: 350px;"></canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Actually Decide</h2>

    <p>If you're trying to figure out which way to go with this stuff, here's what tends to work.</p>

    <p>Start with your actual problems instead of just picking whichever model everyone's talking about. Consider what you're trying to solve, how fast it needs to be, how much you can spend, and what kind of technical skills your people have.</p>

    <p>The smartest setups use different models for different jobs. It takes more work upfront to get the infrastructure right, but you end up with better results for less money pretty quickly.</p>

    <p>Training matters more than you think. The technology changes fast, but whether it actually helps depends on whether your team knows how to use it. A decent model that people understand beats a fancy one that nobody's figured out yet.</p>

    <p>These six models are what works now, but give it six months and things will look different. Build your systems so you can switch between models without rebuilding everything. Being flexible beats being perfectly optimized for any one provider.</p>
